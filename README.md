# 100 Days Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code Challenge! This repository documents my journey of coding consistently for 100 days, exploring various programming concepts, algorithms, and technologies.

## 📋 About

This challenge is a personal commitment to:
- Code for at least an hour every day for 100 consecutive days
- Document my progress and learnings
- Build projects and solve problems
- Improve my programming skills across multiple languages

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This repository includes projects and exercises using:
- **CUDA** (62.6%) - GPU programming and parallel computing
- **C++** (27.4%) - Systems programming and algorithms
- **Python** (8.1%) - Data analysis and scripting
- **C** (1.5%) - Low-level programming
- **CMake** (0.4%) - Build automation

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each day has its own folder containing:
- Source code files
- Problem descriptions (if applicable)
- Notes and learnings
- Build instructions

```
100-Days_challenge/
